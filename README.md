## Installation

```shell
# install pact-go as a dev dependency
go get github.com/pact-foundation/pact-go/v2
# install CLI tools
go install github.com/pact-foundation/pact-go/v2

# download and install the required libraries. The pact-go will be installed into $GOPATH/bin, which is $HOME/go/bin by default. 
pact-go -l DEBUG install 

# üöÄ now write some tests!
```

If the `pact-go` command above is not found, make sure that `$GOPATH/bin` is in your path. I.e.,
```shell
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
```

You can also keep the library versions up to date by running the `version.CheckVersion()` function.

<details><summary>Manual Installation Instructions</summary>

### Manual

Downlod the latest `Pact FFI Library` [library] for your OS, and install onto a standard library search path (we suggest: `/usr/local/lib` on OSX/Linux):

Ensure you have the correct extension for your OS:

- For Mac OSX: `.dylib` (For M1 users, you need the `aarch64-apple-darwin` version)
- For Linux: `.so`
- For Windows: `.dll`

```sh
wget https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-reference/releases/download/libpact_ffi-v0.1.2/libpact_ffi-osx-x86_64.dylib.gz
gunzip libpact_ffi-osx-x86_64.dylib.gz
mv libpact_ffi-osx-x86_64.dylib /usr/local/lib/libpact_ffi.dylib
```

Test the installation:

```sh
pact-go help
```

## Usage

### Consumer package

The consumer interface is in the package: `github.com/pact-foundation/pact-go/v2/consumer`.

#### Writing a Consumer test

Pact is a consumer-driven contract testing tool, which is a fancy way of saying that the API `Consumer` writes a test to set out its assumptions and needs of its API `Provider`(s). By unit testing our API client with Pact, it will produce a `contract` that we can share to our `Provider` to confirm these assumptions and prevent breaking changes.

In this example, we are going to be testing our User API client, responsible for communicating with the `UserAPI` over HTTP. It currently has a single method `GetUser(id)` that will return a `*User`.

Pact tests have a few key properties. We'll demonstrate a common example using the 3A `Arrange/Act/Assert` pattern.

```golang
func TestUserAPIClient(t *testing.T) {
	// Specify the two applications in the integration we are testing
	// NOTE: this can usually be extracted out of the individual test for re-use)
	mockProvider, err := NewV2Pact(MockHTTPProviderConfig{
		Consumer: "UserAPIConsumer",
		Provider: "UserAPI",
	})
	assert.NoError(t, err)

	// Arrange: Setup our expected interactions
	mockProvider.
		AddInteraction().
		Given("A user with ID 10 exists").
		UponReceiving("A request for User 10").
		WithRequest("GET", S("/user/10")).
		WillRespondWith(200).
		WithBodyMatch(&User{})

	// Act: test our API client behaves correctly
	err = mockProvider.ExecuteTest(t, func(config MockServerConfig) error {
		// Initialise the API client and point it at the Pact mock server
		// Pact spins up a dedicated mock server for each test
		client := newClient(config.Host, config.Port)

		// Execute the API client
		user, err := client.GetUser("10")

		// Assert: check the result
		assert.NoError(t, err)
		assert.Equal(t, 10, user.ID)

		return err
	})
	assert.NoError(t, err)
}
```

You can see (and run) the full version of this in `./examples/basic_test.go`.

For a full example, see the Pactflow terraform provider [pact tests](https://github.com/pactflow/terraform-provider-pact/blob/master/client/client_pact_test.go).

### Provider package

The provider interface is in the package: `github.com/pact-foundation/pact-go/v2/provider`

#### Verifying a Provider

A provider test takes one or more pact files (contracts) as input, and Pact verifies that your provider adheres to the contract. In the simplest case, you can verify a provider as per below.

```golang
func TestV3HTTPProvider(t *testing.T) {
	// 1. Start your Provider API in the background
	go startServer()

	verifier := HTTPVerifier{}

	// Verify the Provider with local Pact Files
	// The console will display if the verification was successful or not, the
	// assertions being made and any discrepancies with the contract
	err := verifier.VerifyProvider(t, VerifyRequest{
		ProviderBaseURL: "http://localhost:1234",
		PactFiles: []string{
			filepath.ToSlash("/path/to/SomeConsumer-SomeProvider.json"),
		},
	})

	// Ensure the verification succeeded
	assert.NoError(t, err)
}
```
